        <h3><i>Frontend Tech Stack</i></h3>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        The frontend tech stack is the clientâ€™s side of the application.
        Client-side refers to anything that a user can see or engage with on a
        screen. The main concern of the frontend stack is to create a stellar
        user experience, smooth user interface, and straightforward internal
        structures. In other words, it is responsible for the design, format,
        and navigation of websites or web apps. <br />
        There are three principal elements of a frontend stack. These are:
        <br />
        <b>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) </b>- it's a markup language for
        creating and displaying electronic documents (web pages). They are the
        backbone in the organization and placement of content on a web page.
        <br />
        <b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) </b>- It is responsible for the format
        and layout of the web pages. It includes the font styles, sizes, layout,
        color, and other aspects of a web page. Developers commonly use
        frameworks like SASS and LESS to make CSS more manageable and more
        dynamic.
        <br />
        <b>JavaScript </b> -Used to make web pages interactive. It's a
        programming language that allows you to implement dynamic features on
        web pages; with common libraries and frameworks like jQuery, React,
        Angular, and Vue. Many modern applications now also use TypeScript
        instead of basic JavaScript.
        <br />

        <h3><i>Backend Tech Stack</i></h3>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        The server-side of software development is the backend tech stack. It
        refers to the inner workings of a website or app that users cannot see.
        Think of it as the electric power stations that generate electricity for
        your home. They may seem invisible in the background, but they are
        important to keep the operations running smoothly.
        <br />
        The backend stack includes these elements:
        <br />
        <b>Programming languages-</b>This creates logic for apps and websites.
        The code link the web to a database. Some examples are JavaScript, PHP,
        and Python.
        <br />
        <b>Frameworks -</b>it provides support of applications based on a single
        programming language. Laravel, Django, and Ruby on Rails are few of the
        popular frameworks. Most modern applications are built using an MVC
        style framework.
        <br />
        <b>Web Servers -</b>You need backend servers to manage client requests.
        Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) are the
        most common web servers.
        <br />
        <b>Databases-</b>Most applications require a SQL or NoSQL database.
        MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL are common databases.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      These web development programming languages, frameworks, technologies,
      servers, databases are built on top of each other. Hence, the term tech
      stacks.
